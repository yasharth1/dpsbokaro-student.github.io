 <li class="launchers"> <p style="color:brown;"><strong>PSLV </strong>:The most Succesful Launch Vehicle and ISRO's workhorse.Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is the third generation launch vehicle of India. It is the first Indian launch vehicle to be equipped with liquid stages.Its most significant  success was the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Spacecraft/chandrayaan-1">Chandrayaan 1 </a> and afterwards the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/pslv-c25-mars-orbiter-mission"> Mangalyaan or Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) </a>.After its first successful launch in October 1994, PSLV emerged as the reliable and versatile workhorse launch vehicle of India with 39 consecutively successful missions by June 2017. During 1994-2017 period, the vehicle has launched 48 Indian satellites and 209 satellites for customers from abroad. <br>

<li class="launchers"><p style="color: green;"><strong> GSLV </strong>:The big bro of PSLV.Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark II (GSLV Mk II) is the largest launch vehicle developed by India, which is currently in operation. This fourth generation launch vehicle is a three stage vehicle with four liquid strap-ons. The indigenously developed <a href=https://www.isro.gov.in/update/15-nov-2007/indigenous-cryogenic-stage-successfully-qualified> cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) </a>, which is flight proven, forms the third stage of GSLV Mk II. From January 2014, the vehicle has achieved four consecutive successes.<br>

<li class="launchers"> <p style="color:purple;"><strong>GSLV MK III</strong>:The most powerful Launch Vehicle.GSLV MkIII, chosen to launch <a href=https://www.isro.gov.in/chandrayaan2-home-0> Chandrayaan-2 </a> spacecraft, is a three-stage heavy lift launch vehicle developed by ISRO. The vehicle has two solid strap-ons, a core liquid booster and a cryogenic upper stage.
GSLV Mk III is designed to carry 4 ton class of satellites into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) or about 10 tons to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which is about twice the capability of the GSLV Mk II.
